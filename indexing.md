## What is Indexing?

Indexes are used in order to retrieve data more quickly than without an index. 

An example of why indexing a table is useful would be to equate it to a glossary/index in a textbook. Were you to search for a key word in a book without an index, you would have to read the entire textbook until you found it. Whereas if the textbook contains an index, you can simply look up the word in there and then navigate to the page that is given.



```
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...)
```
